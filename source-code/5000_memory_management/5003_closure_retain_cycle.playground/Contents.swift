 ## Learn Swift with Bob
 ### Swift Memory Management
 ### Closure Retain Cycle 
 
 **Problem:**
 1. How to use `capture lists` to prevent retain cycle in closures
 2. When to use `unowned`

//: Design Independent Class
class Owner {
  var creditCard: CreditCard?
  deinit { print("Owner gone") }

//: Design Dependent Class
class CreditCard {
  unowned let owner: Owner
  
  init(enterOwner: Owner) {
    owner = enterOwner
  }
  
  deinit {
    print("Card gone")
  }
  
}


//: Create Instances
var bob: Owner? = Owner()
var myCard = CreditCard(enterOwner: bob!)

bob?.creditCard = myCard

bob = nil

// myCard.owner // crash



//: > If `self` will never be deallocated before the closure block, use `unowned`. If you try to access the value of an unowned reference after that instance has been deallocated, youâ€™ll get a runtime error.
