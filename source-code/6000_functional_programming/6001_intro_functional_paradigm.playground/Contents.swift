 **Problem:** What is functional programming

//: > “Functional Programming is a paradigm that allows you to make your code explicit. There is no state and no mutality”

//: ### Non-functional Programming
// Somewhere in ViewController
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]
var sum = 0
for number in numbers {
  sum += number
}


// Somewhere in NextViewController
let newNumbers = [4, 5, 6]
var newSum = 0
for newNumber in numbers {
  newSum += newNumber
}



//: > **Bob's Definition:** Functional programming is nothing more than using functions to derive results


//: ### Functional Programming
func saveMeFromMadness(elements: [Int]) -> Int {
  var sum = 0
  for element in elements {
    sum += element
  }
  
  return sum
}

// Somewhere in ViewController
saveMeFromMadness(elements: [1, 2, 3])
// Somewhere in NextViewController
saveMeFromMadness(elements: [4, 5, 6])


/*:
 ### Declarative: Functional
 The user does not care about the process
 
 Ex) Jump off from an airplane vs climb
 
 
 ### Imperative:  Non-Functional
 It tells you how you got the answer from A → B.
 
 Ex) The `for-in` loop

/*: 
 ### Benefits of Functional Programming
 A functional paradigm ensures no mutability or no change in state when used/No explicit state management
 - Modularity
 - Fewer lines 
 - Conventional communication
