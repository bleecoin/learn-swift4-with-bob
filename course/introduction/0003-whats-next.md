# What's Next
You've successfully completed Learn Swift with Bob. Let's have a virtual high-five. When you first started, I promised, you would come out programming in a different playing field if you've follow the path I've designed for you.  If that has happened, let me know on the review.

You've learned one of the most confusing concepts as such detecting memory leak within closures and delegates. You've learned what it means to become a functional programmer. You've learned how to design completion handler blocks. Generic protocols, and so on. There are just too many you've gone through. If you've come this far, you are one of less than 5% who completed this course. I'm very proud of you. You've got a bright future.

Here is one thing that's missing. We haven't made a real app yet. As I have been referring multiple times, the next course is `The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob`. You will learn how to build apps using Protocol Oriented reusable cells, enum oriented along with Realm Database.

If you've finished the entire course, feel free to join the waiting-list/mailing list on my website. I will send you an update time to time. If you also want to get a real-time update from me, you may follow my story on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/bobthedev).

As the final statement, when it comes to learning, always get to the fundamentals ask ask numerous questions on why we do thing, not just on how to apply. Please remember the quote from the Nazi concentration camps, "He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."

See you in the next course. Keep learning.
