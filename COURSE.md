## What Students Say
> "I have been building apps for iOS for about 6-7 years with my first language being Objective-C. I never felt I've mastered the language with the release of Swift. In the past, I found many resources online some were alright and some were terrible turning us into code monkeys without any understanding what was seen. With the help of Bob's intermediate to advnaced Swift course, I have been able to grasp the language way better than I could without his help. His awesome teaching style, approachability and the way Bob uses real world analogies to get a subject across are magnificent. I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to recommend Bob's course to anyone who wishes to learn the language of Swift because that exactly what you will do"
