### What the Students Would Learn
The course covers the 4 pillars of the Swift Programming Language. Object-oriented, protocol-oriented,  value oriented with enum-oriented, functional-oriented programming. You will fully understand how memory is managed including `weak`, `strong`, and `unowned`. You will learn the delegate/singleton pattern. You will learn everything about closures and asynchrious functions. You will learn what makes a Swift a protocol orietned programming langauge by studying the `Sequence`, `Equatable` protocols. The course covers a lot more including intro to test-driven-development and enum-oriented error handling, the latest features of Swift 4 including codable, keypaths, functional dictionary.

This course isn't just about learning the unique features of Swift 4. It is to shift your perspective how you approach coding. Most students lack the fundamentals because they buy into the courses that focus on the final products, They say, "Be a paid developer by building 21 apps." We had enough, It simply doesn't work because I've started my journey with Swift alone.

### What the Students Get Which Other Courses Do Not Offer

1. You will get a life-time access to an eBook available for you. It includes lecture notes, source code, references. You can
2. Detail matters to me.  Along with the 32px font size and zooming and pointer effects, you have no problem watching the lecture on your phone.
3. Your questions will be answered at 100%. I care about the students.
4. My lessons are prepared from top to bottom. I respect your time.
5. You will be invited to the Slack group and get helped when you need.

### Ideal Students
This course is designed for those who have a prior experience with Swift or other languages such as Javascript and Objective-C and understand the basic concepts of `Object Oriented Programming`, `else-if` and `switch` statement. If that's not the case, don't worry. I've attached free beginner's lectures for you.

### Call to Action
Unlike many other courses, I have not signed up for the Udemy's marketing plan. The course is priced at $50 which I believe its the appropriate price for the value you receive in return. However, if you are a student  from third-world countries, I will provide you with student discount.

There is a 30-day money back guarantee. If the course isn't the right fit, you will get your money back for any reasons. If you are not convinced still, you may read the reviews to decide whether the course provides great value for you. But I promise you one thing. You would never code the same you've done in the past if you take this course with me. Let's take your game to the next level.
