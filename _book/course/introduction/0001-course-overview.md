# Course Overview
Before moving onto the first lesson, let us go through the prerequisites, the table of content, and my course expectation for maximized learning experience.

## Table of Content
There are 10 chapters in this course. From Chapter 1 to 4, you will get a firm understanding of Intro to Functional, and Protocol, and Object Oriented Programming. In Chapter 5, you will fully understand how to manage memory through how to allocate and deallocate objects. In Chapter 6 and 8, you will learn how to create value oriented swift code along with functional programming, protocols, generics, and enums. In chapter 9, you will learn all the new features of Swift 4 that may enhance your coding experience and increase productivity In the last chapter, you will acquire various advanced and hidden tips about the Swift programming language.

## Course Expectation
Based on the Stack Overflow survey in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, don't let its readability and hype fool you. It's a complex language inspired by many. Let us through the course expectation.

### Be Skeptical
I’m a biased human being. I hope you do not trust me all the way. If you spot any practices that raise your eyebrows, make sure challenge me and come up with a better solution. Although I try to prevent that from happening through doing my homework, I encourage you to think outside of the box.

### Be Proactive
You might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what the issue is. Copy and paste the error message on Google. Ask me questions. Do whatever it takes. Do not move on without knowing the cause and how you could prevent them from occurring in the future.

### Learning Mentality
Learning is done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to show you how to use nets and fish rods. After this course, you are expected to use those tools on your own. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of yourself.

## Ideal Learning Stage
Let us through an ideal learning stage for the students. If you need more, feel free to send me an email. If not, let's move on to what's covered in this course.

| Step | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| The Why | Each lesson should flow like a story. In the beginning, I start off with a problem statement. It consists of doubts and questions I personally encountered. For example, I would ask, what's the purpose of using `optionals`? A problem statement organically leads to why we learn.
| Application | After having gone through the specific problem statement by showing new features and how to use them, I present how it applies to real-life situations.
| Resources | With additional resources and references, you may go further study on your own. |
| Visualization | It's your turn. I don't believe in practice problems. We no longer live in a world where there are fixed answers. You visualize how the feature you've learned can be applicable for your future endeavor. Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge". Practice problems turn you into a machine. We have more than enough by the current education system designed to reduce cost for individual measurements.
| Test |  It's time to put your visualization into practice. You should fail. That's good. You are trying something new. "Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough" - Elon Musk |

Lastly, let's get real. It's important to get excited. However, it is also important to acknowledge upcoming hardships because we will eventually hit the wall. Let's get ready mentally. If you are down, let your journey being.


## Resources
I've prepared a list of resources that would maximize your learning potential. I want you to succeed. Again, learning is done by you. In this course, I will provide you all the tools and resources you need to become a better Swift developer.

### Lecture Notes
First, I've created an online ebook which contains source code, explanations, resources, and references.  The website is mobile-friendly so that you can study Swift even in the bathroom since phone these days are water-proof. You may also use it as a reference of itself since it supports searching on the top left corner.

### Group Chat
You may join Bob the Developer Slack Group and help one another. If you wish to join, you may send me an email at `bob@bobthedeveloper.io `. I will send you an invitation link. The group remains exclusive. You might have to wait 24-48 hours since I have to check the email one by one.

### Supporting Articles
I have attached  articles and references that I use to prepare for this course. Feel free to use them to further study on your own which I fundamentally expect all of the students to do.

### Updates
Lastly, I share detailed updates with my readers and students on the [Facebook Page](https://facebook.com/bobthedeveloper). To get to know me as a personal level, you can follow my story on Instagram [@bobthedev](https://instagram.com/bobthedev).
