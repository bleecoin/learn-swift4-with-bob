Swift with Bob\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nAs a developer whose first programming language is Swift, I've taken online courses from major platforms. However, I have been frustrated by a lack of detailed explanations from instructors. They tend to focus on final products, thus missing out the fundamentals. I was confused by which design principles to follow, and why. After I've been blogging for the last 5 months, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've received hundreds of emails and questions regarding how to write code that does not violate principles such as DRY, modularity, and readability. As a result, I've decided to create this course dedicated for my younger self. I believe it all comes down to the fundamentals which I lacked in the beginning.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy. If you wish to receive a discount link, use the coupon code here.\n\nReference\nThis is a platform for my students to download the source code, lecture notes, and scripts. As a life-long student, I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned. Most instructors avoid documenting since it takes effort besides making videos alone. I chose the road less traveled to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.\nPersonal Motivation\nI feel grateful for what learning offers in my life. It would have been impossible for me to create this course and communicate in English. I've decided to devote my career providing affordable education channels for all people globally. As a person who has lived in third world countries and also attended college in NYC, I understand, education is the way for anyone rise up and increase a standard of living and quality of life. To pursue this grand goal, I have started off with teaching iOS development to raise funds and increase my personal brand.\nI can't even...

I've chosen topics that distinguish Swift from any other modern programming languages. You will learn how to identify and distinguish every ? and ! in the Swift programming language. You no longer have to rely on the vague instructions from Xcode.\nYou will also learn standard practices through generics, error handling and guard statement to create reusable, modular, and safe lines of code. Swift provides us with amazing tools to work with, such as optional chainings and extension. Let's utilize them as much.\nI started my programming journey with Swift. I understand the struggles you go through. You may have experienced a lack of confidence when you were asked to show your code to someone else. You may have asked yourself whether you've been writing decent lines of code.\nFrom now on, don't you worry. You've come to the right place with me, Bob the Developer. When you follow my lead, you will come out programming in a different playing field. If you have any questions along the way, feel free to comment below. Let's begin the first step.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/optionals.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/optionals.html","title":"Optionals","keywords":"","body":"Optionals\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the first lesson of The Swift Fundamentals. When I first started programming in Swift, I took courses from Udemy, Treehouse, Lynda, and many more. Yet, I could not understand what those ?s and !s stood for.  Xcode kept telling me what to do on the left side, causing more problems. It seemed like no instructor could explain the reasoning behind how to use optionals, and most importantly, why the Swift engineers have implemented such a feature that is unique compared to other programming languages. Today, You will discover the rationale behind with me.\nProblem\nWhy did the Swift engineers implement optionals?\nSwift Rules\n\nEvery variable type must be defined (Implicit/Explicit)\nThe type is inferred based on the value\n\n// String\nlet name: String = \"Bob\"          // Explicit\nlet newName = \"Bob the Developer\" // Implicit\n\n// Numbers\nlet myAge: Int = 20               // Explicit\nlet mySisterAge = 14              // Implicit\nlet myGPA: Double = 3.54          // Explicit\n\nFetching Profile Picture\nWhen you fetch a profile picture from Facebook, it may return no value, a.k.anil. However, you may not store nil to a normal type based on the rule above.\n// Successful\nlet myProfileImageURL: String = \"https//facebook.com/bobthedeveloper\"\n// Error\nlet myProfilePictureURL: String = nil\n\nIntroduction to Optionals\nOptionals allow storing nil, a.k.a absence of value.\nlet myName: String? = nil\nlet yourName: String? = \"Bob Lee\"\n\nprint(myName) // nil   \nprint(yourName) // Optional(\"Bob Lee\")\n\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\nlet robAge: Int? = 123\nlet danAge: Int? = 3\n\nOptionals Rules\n\nOptionals/Normal Types do not interact with each other\nConvert Optionals to Normal Types for usage. The process is also known as unwrapping.\n\nrobAge + danAge\n// Error\n\nOptionals Unwrapping\nThere are two ways to convert/unwrap optional types to normal types\n\nForced unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping\n\nForced Unwrapping\n You may convert by inserting ! at the end of  the variable. Forced Unwrapping should be avoided since it causes a crash if the optional type contains nil since a normal type can't store nil.\nlet newRobAge = robAge!\nprint(newRobAge) // normal type\nlet newDanAge = danAge!\nprint(newRobAge) // normal type\n\nProblem\nvar image: String? = nil\n\nNow, let us force unwrap image.\nvar image! // Error\n\nIt does not work because you are not allow to store nil to a normal type. Again, unwrapping refers to the process of converting from an optional type to a normal type.\n\nYou can't store nil to a normal type in Swift. It violates the Swift rule.\n\nImplicit Unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping is a safe way to convert. If the optional type contains nil, it does not break the system. Instead, it ignores. Implicit unwrapping is an added feature to an else-if statement.\nlet imageFromFaceBook: String? = \"Bob's Face\"\n\nif let normalImage = imageFromFaceBook {\n  print(normalImage) // normalImage is a constant\n} else {\n  print(\"There is no image\")\n}\n\nNow normalImage contains a normal type of String. You may use the normalImage constant within the if block. On the contrary, if imageFromFaceBook contains nil, Swift executes the else block instead.\nSource Code\n\noptionals.playground\n\nResources\n\n\nConclusion\nYou've learned two fundamental concepts in the Swift Programming Language. The rule number one states, every type, even if optionals, has to be defined explicitly or implicitly. Second, there are two ways to unwrap optionals to normal types.  You may force unwrap with ! or safety unwrap with if-let.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn why ? and ! automatically appear when you create an object and access its properties and methods.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/optional-chainings.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/optional-chainings.html","title":"Optional Chainings","keywords":"","body":"Optionals Chainings\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of The Swift Fundamentals. In the previous lesson, you've learned why we use optionals and how to convert them to normal types.\nHowever, you might have wondered why ? and ! automatically appear when you access properties and methods of an object. If you haven't, that's okay. The goal is to prevent you from guessing. Let us find out what goes under the hood\nProblem\nWhy do I see ? and ! when accessing methods and properties?\nOptional Chaining in UIKit\nYou might have seen,\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel().highlightedTextColor?.cgColor\n\nThe mysterious ? appears all of a sudden. Let us attempt to replicate the phenomenon.\nDesign Human\nCreate a class, Human, which contains a String property, name and a method, sayHello().\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n\n  func sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello, I'm \\(name)\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Apartment\nCreate a class, Apartment, which contains a property whose type is Human?.\nclass Apartment {\n  var human: Human?\n}\n\nInitialize Property\nCreate an instance of Apartment and assign its human property.\nvar seoulApartment = Apartment()\nseoulApartment.human = Human(name: \"Bobby Lee\")\n\nCall Property and Method\nNow, try to grab the human property of seoulApartment. Since the type of human is optional, ? gets added automatically.\n\nRules: When you access a property whose type is optional, Swift will add ?. Anything that comes after the ? will be optional.\n\nvar myName = seoulApartment.human?.name // Always return an `optional` type since human is `optional`.\n\nmyName is an optional type. Therefore, unwrapping is needed.\nif let residentName = NYCAparment.human?.name {\n  print(residentName) // non-optional\n} else {\n  print(\"No name available\")\n}\n\nForce Unwrap\nYou may force unwrap while optional chaining. However, if the property is not initialized, it will crash.\nvar NYCApartment = Apartment()\nlet NYCResident = NYCApartment.human!.name // Error: No value for human\n\nSource Code\n\n1002-optional-chainings.playground\n\nResources\nMy Favorite Xcode Shortcuts Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 by Bob Lee\nConclusion\nYou've learned optional chaingins provide shortcuts to nested properties and methods among classes and structs. However, a ? automatically appears when you access a property whose type is optional to indicate that anything that comes after may contain no value since the optional property may be nil.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to use a guard statement to implicitly unwrap multiple optionals instead of a classic if let statements.

When I started learning Swift for the first time, an else-if statement made sense. However, a guard statement rather seemed daunting. In fact, the name doesn't tell anything about what it does. One day, however, I discovered something. A guard statement is just another for you to write an else-if statement. A guard statement promotes zenness. In other words, it adds clarity, emptiness, and lots of cloud and space. Let us find out through the examples.\n\nZenness: A trait where peace, calmness, and inner awesomeness are all intertwined - Urban Dictionary\n\nProblem\n\nIs there any alternative way to write an else-if statement?\nHow do you safely unwrap multiple optionals?\n\nTypical Else-If\nWithout having known about guard, you have used a long else-if statement to indicate an error message block.\nfunc checkDrinkingAge() {\n  let canDrink = true\n\n  if canDrink {\n    print(\"You may enter\")\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n\n  } else {\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    print(\"Let me take you to the jail\")\n  }\n}\n\nIssues with Else-If\n\nNested brackets\nHave to read every line to spot the error message\n\nGuard Statement\nA guard block only runs if the condition is false, and it will exit out of the function through return. If the condition is true, Swift ignores the guard block. It provides an early exit and fewer brackets.\nfunc checkDrinkProgram() {\n  let iCanDrink = true\n\n  guard iCanDrink else {\n    // if iCanDrink == false, run this block\n    print(\"Let's me take you to the jail\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"You may drink\")\n  // You may move on\n  // Come on.\n  // You may leave\n  // You don't need to read this.\n  // Only one bracket on the bottom: feeling zen.\n}\n\nUnwrap Optionals with Else-If\nA guard statement is not only useful for replacing a typical conditional block with an else-if statement, but also great for unwrapping optionals by minimizing the number of brackets. To compare, let's first begin how to unwrap multiple optionals with else-if.\nFirst, let us create three optionals that will be unwrapped.\nvar publicName: String? = \"Bob Lee\"\nvar publicPhoto: String? = \"Bob's Face\"\nvar publicAge: Int? = nil\n\nThe Worst Nightmare\nYou never want to do this.\nfunc unwrapOneByOne() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    if let photo = publicPhoto {\n      if let age = publicAge {\n        print(\"Bob: \\(name), \\(photo), \\(age)\")\n      } else {\n        print(\"age is mising\")\n      }\n    } else {\n      print(\"photo is missing\")\n    }\n  } else {\n    print(\"name is missing\")\n  }\n}\n\nThe code above certainly works but violates the DRY principle. It's atrocious. Let us break it down.\n\nDRY: Don't Repeat Yourself\n\nSlightly Better\nThe code below is more readable than above.\nfunc unwrapBetter() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    print(\"Yes name\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No name\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let photo = publicPhoto {\n    print(\"Yes photo\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No photo\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let age = publicAge {\n    print(\"Yes age\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No age\")\n    return\n  }\n}\n\n\nWhen Swift encounters return, it stops and exits out of the function immediately\n\nUnwrap with Guard\nThe else-if statements can be replaced with guard.\nfunc unwrapOneByOneWithGuard() {\n  guard let name = publicName else {\n    print(\"Name missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  guard let photo = publicPhoto else {\n    print(\"Photo missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  guard let age = publicAge else {\n    print(\"Age missing\")\n    return\n  }\n  print(name)\n  print(photo)\n  print(age)\n}\n\nUnwrap Multiple Optionals with Else-If\nSo far, you've been unwrapping optionals one by one. Swift allows us to unwrap multiple optionals at once. If one of them contains nil, it will execute the else block.\nfunc unwrap() {\n  if let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge {\n    print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your face right here, \\(photo), you are \\(age)\")\n  } else {\n    // if any one of those is missing\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: Be aware that when you unwrap multiple optionals at once, you can't identify which contains nil.\n\nUnwrap Multiple Optionals with Guard\nOf course, we should use guard over else-if.\nfunc unwrapWithGuard() {\n  guard let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge else {\n    // if one or two of the variables contain \"nil\"\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your, \\(photo). You are \\(age).\")\n  // Animation Logic\n  // Networking\n  // More Code, but still zen\n}\n\nDefer Statement\n\nDefer Statement: Put off (an action or event) to a later time; postpone.\n\nA defer block only executes only after current scope (loop, method, etc) exits.\nfunc simpleDefer() {\n  defer { print(\"Chill, later\")  }\n  print(\"Print First\")\n}\n\nLet us execute the simpleDefer() function.\nsimpleDefer()\n// \"Print First\"\n// \"Chill, later\"\n\nAnother example,\nfor i in 1...3 {\n  defer { print (\"Deferred \\(i)\") }\n  print (\"First \\(i)\")\n}\n\n// First 1\n// Deferred 1\n// First 2\n// Deferred 2\n// First 3\n// Deferred 3\n\nUsage Case for Defer\n\nExecuting completion handler blocks which you will learn in Chapter 3.  \nAny code you want to explicitly inform your team without requiring them to read the entire function\n\nSource Code\n\n1003-guard-defer-statement.playground\n\nConclusion\nIn this lesson, you've learned the power of guard over typical else-if.  First, it provides an early exit. Second, no one has to read the entire function to spot the error messages. You use a guard statement not just to please yourself, but for the sake of your teammates' falling hair when he/she reads your code. Keep guarding, everyone. Don't defer your learning, however.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/intro-error-handling.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/intro-error-handling.html","title":"Intro to Error Handling","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Error Handling\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 4, Intro to Error Handling, of The Swift Fundamentals. I feared Error Handling. I thought I had to be a professional debugger to fully utilize the feature. However, one day, I discovered, again. It's nothing more than writing an else-if block to send and deal with the error messages you've designed on your own. The built-in features of Error Handling since Swift 2.0 allow you to write cleaner, modular, and readable code.\nProblem\n\nHow do you warn your co-workers the function may result unexpected outcomes?\nWhat is a do-try block?\nHow do you distinguish between try?, try!, and try?\n\nDesign Safety Feature\nDesign a safety check for riders based on height. If the passenger is taller than 2m or below 1.4m, the program will send error messages along with other instructions.\nfunc checkHeight(height: Int) {\n  if height > 200 {\n    print(\"You are going to hit your head and fall off\")\n    // Take him/her off from the ride\n    // Code ...\n    // Seatbelt tighten\n\n  } else if height \nProblem with Else-If alone\n\nBloated function\nLack of modularity\nUncertainty\n\nError Handling\nError Handling is just additional way to write an else-if statement to not only deal with the error messages but also respond after them in a separate block.\nDesign Error\nCreate an enum that conforms to the Error protocol. Determine a few cases.  \nenum HeightError: Error {\n  case maxHeight\n  case minHeight\n}\n\n\nAny type that declares conformance to the Error protocol can be used to represent an error in Swift’s error handling system. Because the Error protocol has no requirements of its own, you can declare conformance on any custom type you create.\n\nDesign Throwable Function\nCreate a function that can throw/return errors by inserting throws at the end of the function parameter. The function does not contain error messages. Instead, it \"throws\" an error which will be \"caught\" and handled in a separate block with do-try.\nfunc checkHeightError(height: Int) throws {\n  if height > 200 {\n    throw HeightError.maxHeight\n  } else if height \nCall and Handle Error\nTo call a function that contains throws, the function requires try within a do block. A catch block is used to recognize and the error thrown by the function. If there is no error thrown, the catch block is ignored.\ndo {\n  try checkHeightError(height: 240)\n} catch HeightError.maxHeight {\n  print(\"Get out of here\")\n  // Logic\n} catch HeightError.minHeight {\n  print(\"Too short to ride\")\n}\n\nError Handling with Object Initialization\nDesign Error\nenum NameError: Error {\n  case noName\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Class\nWhen the user enters an empty string when initializing, the init method throws NameError.noName.\nclass Course {\n  var name: String\n\n  init(name: String) throws {\n    if name == \"\" {\n      throw NameError.noName\n    } else {\n      self.name = name\n      print(\"You've created an object!\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nInitialize and Handle Error\nCreate an object using try within a do-catch block.\ndo {\n  let myCourse = try Course(name: \"\")\n} catch NameError.noName {\n  print(\"Error: please make sure enter name!\")\n  // Logic\n}\n\nDistinguish Between try?, try!, and try\ntry is only used within a do-catch block. However, try? and try! can be used without it.\n\nYou may get away using try without a do-try block within Playground, but it is not allowed in anywhere else.\n\ntry?\nIt returns an optional type. If it throws an error, the result will be nil.\nlet newCourse = try? Course(name: \"Bob the Dev\") // returns Course?\nlet newDopeCourse = try? Course(name: \"\") // nil\n\ntry!\nIt returns a normal type. If the method/init throws an error, it will crash.\nlet myNewCourse = try! Course(name: \"Bobby Lee\") // &#x1F44D;\nlet myDopeNewCourse = try! Course(name: \"\") // ☠️\n\nSource Code\n\n1004-intro-error-handling.playground\n\nResources\n\nIntro to Error Handling in Swift by Bob Lee\n\nConclusion\nYou've learned the Swift Error Handling syntax such as catch, do, and try. To recap, you may only use try within a do-catch block to execute a throwable method. However, you may also use try? and try! alone. Again, avoid using! in most cases since it will break your program. If you wish to review or feel stuck, I've attached an additional article for you to study as well.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn the final usage of ! and ? in the Swift Programming Language through type castingwhich allows you to convert types that are made up of classes and possibly with structs. &#x1F914;\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/type-casting.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/type-casting.html","title":"Type Casting","keywords":"","body":"Type Casting\nIntroduction\nWelcome to lesson 5 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. You've learned a number of ! and ? since Lesson 1. These are language features that distinguish Swift from the rest, and you've got to know all, when, where, how, and, most importantly, why.\nIn this lesson, you learn how to convert types in objects that are created with classes and structs. In fact, if you use Storyboard in iOS, you must know type casting.\nProblem\n\nHow do you distinguish between as, as?, as!?\nWhy does Xcode keep telling me what to do?\n\nType Casting in UIKit\nYou might have seen,\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel() as UIView\n\nYou've converted UILabel to UIView. UILabel is a subclass of UIView. Let us attempt to replicate the phenomenon with custom classes.\n The UIKit framework hierarchy\nHuman Class\nDesign a class called, Human that contains a single method.\nclass Human {\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm a human\")\n  }\n}\n\nHuman Subclass\nDesign Korean and Japanese which inherit from the Human class.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  func singGangNamStyle() {\n    print(\"Oppa Gangnam Style\")\n  }\n}\n\nclass Japanese: Human {\n  func doNinja() {\n    print(\"Shhh.....\")\n  }\n}\n\nCheck if all good\nlet bob = Korean()\nbob.introduce() // \"Hi, I'm a human\"\nbob.singGangNamStyle() // \"Oppa Gangnam Style\"\n\nType Casting\nYou may convert Korean to Human or vice versa. There are two ways: upcasting and downcasting.\nUpcasting\nUpcasting occurs when an object converts its type to the base class. In the early above, you've upcasted UILabel to UIView using as.\n\nThe word \"up\" aligns with the structure in the graph above.\n\nlet newBob = bob as Human  // Korean -> Human\nnewBob.introduce()\nnewBob.singGangNamStyle() // Does not exist\n\nUpcasting Example in Swift Struct\nvar name = \"Bob\" as Any\nvar number = 20 as Any\nvar anyArray = [name, number] // [Any]\n\n\nI forgot to mention that Int and String are struct types which lack base classes. However, structs may only \"upcast\" to Any.\n\nDowncasting\nDowncasting is the opposite. You may downcast Any to String. However, it may fail since Any could contain many types. Analogous to optionals, there are two ways to downcast: Force downcasting or Implicit downcasting\nForce Downcasting\nIt does not return an optional type.  but if it fails, it crashes.\n// Force Downcasting\nlet newValue = anyArray[0] as! String\nlet newValue = anyArray[1] as! String // Error\n\n\nDowncasting is only available only after upcasting.\n\nImplicit Downcasting\n It returns an optional type. If it fails, it returns nil.\nlet newNewValue = anyArray[0] as? Int\nprint(newNewValue) // Optional(20)\n\nType Casting in Practice\nCreate Instances\nlet shion = Japanese()\nlet lee = Korean()\nlet kenji = Japanese()\nlet park = Korean()\n\nCreate Array Using Upcasting\n let humans: [Human] = [shion as Human, lee as Human, kenji as Human, park as Human]\n\nAutomatic upcasting\nlet humans: [Human] = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\nlet humans = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\n\nLoop\nfor human in humans {\n  if let korean = human as? Korean {\n    korean.singGangNamStyle()\n  }\n\n  if let japanese = human as? Japanese {\n    japanese.doNinja()\n  }\n}\n\nUsage in iOS Development\nTypecasting can be used to group UI Components and add attributes as a whole.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet loginButton = UIButton()\nlet loginMessage = UILabel()\nlet loginView = UIView()\n\nlet UIComponents = [loginButton, loginMessage, loginView]\n\nfor component in UIComponents {\n  if let button = component as? UIButton {\n    // Change background color\n    // Add Title\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  if let label = component as? UILabel {}\n  if let view = component as? UIView {}\n}\n\n\nImportant: Upcasting is not a recommended practice since there is a better way to go about: Protocol Oriented Programming. I mention drawbacks of using type casting through comparison in Chapter 3 and 5.\n\nAnother Example\nTo fetch a view controller from Storyboard, downcast to identify the designated view controller.\nlet storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil)\nlet vc = storyboard instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"VC\")\n// type of vc = UIViewController\nlet vc = storyboard instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"VC\") as! VC\n// type of vc = VC\n\nSource Code\n\n1005-type-casting.playground\n\nReference\n\nAnyObject and Any in Swift on Stack Overflow\n\nConclusion\nI lied. I said type casting allowed to convert types in classes. However, you may also convert Int and String to Any even though they are made up of structs, not classes.\nUnnecessary type casting is not recommended among iOS developers because it causes a massive headache from casting back and forth. There is an alternative to go about. You will learn how to group objects together through Protocol Oriented Swift in Chapter 3. I know you are excited. Learn fast, but stay patient and consistent.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to design reusable code through generics. You will come out dry, not wet, a.k.a we enjoy typing.  \n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/generics.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/generics.html","title":"Intro to Generics","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Generics\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 6 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. When you think of the word, \"generic\", what makes you think? Well, I'm sure you've thought of versatile code. What? Don't you dare worry. I will walk you through. Remember, the number one goal is to write as little as possible, but produce as much.\nProblem\nI smell something.\n\nFor the reference, read more about code smell\n\nAccess Elements\nLet us reflect on how we rolled in the past.\nlet highSchoolGPA = [2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8, 3.5]\nlet favoritePeople = [\"Elon Musk\", \"Steve Jobs\", \"Kevin O'leary\"]\nlet favoriteNumbers = [3, 20]\n\nThe Worst way to access elements\nhighSchoolGPA[0]\nhighSchoolGPA[1]\nhighSchoolGPA[2]\n\nLoop and Print\nThis is slightly better.\nfunc printDoubleElement(array: [Double]) {\n  for GPA in array {\n    print(GPA)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printStringElement(array: [String]) {\n  for person in array {\n    print(\"I love \\(person)\")\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printNumberElement(array: [Int]) {\n  for number in array {\n    print(\"I like \\(number)\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nNeedlessly many functions. It goes against the DRY principle.\n\nIntroducing Generics\nA generic function allows you to pass any value regardless of types.   \nfunc genericFunction(value: anything) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nfunc genericFunctions(value: WHATEVER) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nSwift infers the type of anything or WHATEVER based on the input.\ngenericFunction(value: \"Bob\")  // anything is String\ngenericFunctions(value: true)    // WHATVER is Bool\n\nGeneric Loop\nLet us create a generic function.\nfunc printElement(array: [T]) {\n  for element in array {\n    print(element)\n  }\n}\n\nCall the function\nprintElement(array: highSchoolGPA) // 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, ...\nprintElement(array: favoritePeople) // 'Elon Musk\", \"Steve Jobs\", ...\n\n\nGeneric code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions, classes, enums, protocols, and structs subject to requirements that you define.\n\nNow only you can create generic functions, but also generic classes and structs. Let us begin with a non-generic struct.\nNon-Generic Struct\nCreate a Family struct that contains members whose type is [String]. Add a method that appends to the array.\nstruct Family {\n  var members = [String]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: String) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The mutating keyword is added to function of enum and struct that mutates its own property/properties.\n\nNon-Generic Instance\nvar myFam = Family()\nmyFam.push(member: \"Bob\")\nmyFam.members // [\"Bob\"]\n\nThe struct above only works with String. Some families may have names in Int. Then, you must create a new struct. It goes against the DRY principle.\nGeneric Struct\nstruct genericFam {\n  var members = [T]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: T) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\nInstead of using WHATEVER or anything, T is a standard among iOS developers.\nDefine Type Explicitly\nNow, let us create an object from the generic struct. You have to specify the type based on the rule in Lesson 1.\nvar myGenericFamily = genericFam()\nmyGenericFamily.push(member: \"Bobby\")\n\nvar genericFamily = genericFam()\ngenericFamily.push(member: 123)\n\nDefine Type Implicitly\nHowever, the type can be inferred based on the input.\nlet myHappyFamily = genericFam(members: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  // T becomes Int\n\nGeneric Extension\nYou may add an extension to generics for more features. Let us grab the first element in the members property.\nextension genericFam {\n  var firstElement: T? {\n    if members.isEmpty {\n      return nil\n    } else {\n      return members[0]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet geekFamilyMember = genericFam(members: [\"Bob\", \"Bobby\"])\nlet firstElement = geekFamilyMember.firstElement // \"Bob\"\n\nType Constraints\nSo far, you could enter any value to define T. But, you may restricts the type you only want to interact with.\nFirst, design two classes.\nclass LOL {}\nclass BabyLol: LOL {}\n\nNow, let's create a function that only allows you to enter LOL.\nfunc addLOLClassOnly(array: [T]) { }\n\nWhen you run the addLOLClassOnly function, you can't add anything besides whose type is LOL.\naddLOLClassOnly(array: [LOL(), LOL(), LOL(), BabyLol()])\naddLOLClassOnly(array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // Error\n\n\nImportant: BabyLol() has been automatically upcasted to LOL.\n\nResources\n\nIntro to Generics in Swift by Bob Lee\n\nSource Code\n\n1006-intro-to-generics.playground\n\nConclusion\nYou now understand how to maintain yourself dry through generic functions and structs. In later chapters, you will more about advanced generics along with enums and protocols. If you wish to review generic the syntax, I recommend you to watch the lecture again or refer to the article I've attached.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to provide shortcuts within classes and structs instead of calling methods and properties.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/subscripts.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/subscripts.html","title":"Subscripts","keywords":"","body":"Subscripts\nIntroduction\nWelcome to lesson 7, Subscripts, of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob.

Second, you will discover why structs do not provide inheritance.\nProblem\n\nWhat are the differences besides inheritance?\nWhen to use structs over classes?\n\nDesign Class\nTo demonstrate the difference between classes and structs, first design a class, HumanClass that has a name property.\nclass HumanClass {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Instance\nvar humanClassObject = HumanClass(name: \"Bob\")\nhumanClassObject.name // \"Bob\"\n\nCreate another instance that \"copies\" humanClassObject\nlet newHumanClassObject = humanClassObject\n\nChange the name property of newHumanClassObject to \"Bobby\".\nhumanClassObject.name = \"Bobby\"\nnewHumanClassObject.name // \"Bobby\"\n\nThe name property of newHumanClassObject has been changed to \"Bobby\" as well.\nDesign Struct\nLet us find out if the same behavior occurs with an object created with structs\nstruct HumanStruct {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Instance\nCreate another instance that \"copies\" structObject\nvar structObject = HumanStruct(name: \"Bob\")\nlet newStructObject = structObject\n\nChange the name property of structObject to \"Bobby\".\nstructObject.name = \"Bobby\"\nnewStructObject.name // \"Bob\"\n\nOn the contrary, the change on the name property of structObject has no effect on newStructObject.name.\n The graph below shows the fundamental difference between value types vs reference types.\n The difference between Value and Reference Types\nClasses\nFor classes, when you create an instance that \"copies\", the new instance shares the object with the original instance.\nlet newHumanClassObject = humanClassObject // share\n\nStructs\nFor structs, when you create an instance that \"copies\", the new instance creates an identical copy of the object, and the object is not shared.\nlet newStructObject = structObject // copy-paste\n\nMutability\nDue to the fundamental difference, there is an interesting discrepancy when it comes to creating instances with let.\nMutability in Classes\nLet us create an instance with let and attempt to mutate its property.\nclass BobClass {\n  var name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\n// Create Instance\nlet bobClass = BobClass()\nbobClass.name = \"Bobby\"\n\nlet newBobClass = bobClass\n\nnewBobClass.name = \"Bob the Developer\"\nbobClass.name // \"Bob the Developer\"\n\nAlthough the instance, bobClass has been created with let, the property of it has been mutated. It is possible since the instance does not own the object. Instead, it has a reference to theBobClass object in the cloud/RAM.\nNo Mutability in Structs\nstruct BobStruct {\n  var name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\nlet bobStruct = BobStruct()\nbobStruct.name\n\nbobStruct.name = \"Bob Lee\"\n// Error: Immutable\n\nWith structs, when an instance is created with a constant, let, it's not possible to mutate its property since the instance has its own copy and the let protects anyone from interfering with its own instance.\n\nImportant: Value types \"store\", while reference types \"point\".  \n\nWhen to use Struct/Value Type?\n\n10,000 - 1,000,000 faster than classes - Stack Overflow\nNo mutability due to no relationship between objects\nNon-nested structure\n\nResources\nTo learn more about cons of Object Oriented Programming, you may read the beginning of [Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming].\n\nIntro to Protocol Oriented Programming by Bob Lee\n\nReferences\n\nIf you're subclassing, you are doing it wrong by Hector Matos\nAll evidence points to OOP being bullshit by John Barker\nObject Oriented Programming is exceptionally bad by LeaseWeb labs\nWhy Choose Struct Over Class? on Stack OverFlow\n\nSource Code\n\n1008-class-struct-difference.playground\n\nConclusion\nYou've learned the distinction betweenclasses and structs when it comes to creating objects. Instances with classes have references to the object while withstructs store. As a result, classes are called reference types while structs and enums, are value types.\nAt this point, you may find no incentive to learn the difference. You are right. For small apps, it doesn't matter. But, once you start implementing closures and delegates, and other reference related tasks,  you would soon discover a little more complexity which you will learn how to solve in Chapter 5. You will appreciate value types along with Protocol Oriented Programming soon.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/set-tuple.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/set-tuple.html","title":"Set and Tuple","keywords":"","body":"Set and Tuple\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 9 of The Swift Fundamentals. There are two objectives. The first is to learn how to group a list of items with sets. The second is to work with various types within a single variable/constant with tuples.\nProblem\n\nI'd love to eliminate duplicated items: sets\nI'd love to combine all kinds of types: tuples\n\nIntroducing Sets\nA set stores values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering and no duplicated elements.\nMultiple Ways to Create Arrays\nBefore we create sets in Swift, let's review multiple ways to create an array.\n\nRemember, Array is just a generic struct.\n\nvar arrayOne: [Double] = [] // Most Common\nvar arrayTwo = [Double]()\n\nvar arrayThree: Array = []\nvar arrayFour: Array = Array()\nvar arrayFive = Array([1123.08, 234.23])\n\nvar arraySix = Array(1...100)\nvar arraySeven = Array(repeatElement(\"Bob\", count: 10))\n\n\nRemember, Set is just a generic struct.\n\nMultiple Ways to Create Sets\nSet in Swift looks similar to Array.\nvar setOne: Set = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar setTwo: Set = [\"Bob\", \"Bobby\", \"Bob the Developer\"]\nvar emptySet = Set()\n\nBuilt-In Set Methods\nSimilar to Array, Set contains default methods and properties.\nemptySet.insert(\"Bob\")\nemptySet.contains(\"Bob\") // true\nemptySet.remove(\"Bob\")\n\nCreate Two Arrays\nYou may convert Array to Set, or vice versa. In this example, let us convert Array to Set. First, create two arrays filled with odd and even numbers.\nvar oddNumbers: [Int] = []\nvar evenNumbers: [Int] = []\n\nfor number in 1...50 {\n  if number % 2 == 0 {\n    evenNumbers.append(number)\n  } else {\n    oddNumbers.append(number)\n  }\n}\n\nTernary Operator\nfor number in 1...50 {\n  (number % 2 == 0) ? evenNumber.append(number) : oddNumber.append(number)\n}\n\nCheck\noddNumbers // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...]\nevenNumbers // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...]\n\nConvert Array to Set\nvar oddNumberSet = Set(oddNumbers)\nlet evenNumberSet = Set(evenNumbers)\n\noddNumberSet and evenNumberSet no longer has defined order.\nBuilt-In Set Methods\nSet provides methods to work with multiple sets.\n Built-in Set methods\nUnion\noddNumberSet.union(evenNumberSet)\n\nSymmetric Difference\noddNumberSet.symmetricDifference(evenNumberSet)\n\nIntersection\noddNumberSet.intersection(evenNumberSet)\n\nSubtract\noddNumberSet.subtract(evenNumberSet)\n\nvar numberSet = Set([1, 2, 3])\nlet secondNumberSet = Set([1, 2])\n\nnumberSet.subtract(secondNumberSet)\nprint(numberSet) // {3}\n\nSubtract mutates oddNumberSet. Therefore, the oddNumberSet instance must be var rather than let. You can predict whether a method is mutating or not based on the naming guide below.\nSwift Naming Guide\n\n\n\nMutating\nNon-Mutating\n\n\n\n\nverb\nadjective\n\n\narray.append()\narray.sorted()\n\n\narray.sort()\narray.appending\n\n\n\nSort\nSince sets do not provide any order, sets must be converted to an array type to be sorted. There is a built-in method called, sorted().\nlet sortedArray = evenNumberSet.sorted()\nprint(sortedArray) // [2, 4, 6, ...]\n\nFunctional Programming\nThe sorted() is flexible.\nlet sortedArrayFromHighToLow = evenNumberSet.sorted { $0 > $1 }\nprint(sortedArrayFromHighToLow) // [100, 98, 96, ...]\n\nIn this course, you are not going to learn how sorted() is constructed. However, if you are interested in learning more about Functional/Reactive Programming with RxSwift and MVVM, you can be on the mailing list.\nPractical Usage of Set\n\nFinding unique letters and unique visitors\nAny game logic (Up to your imagination)\n\nIntroducing Tuples\nYou may combine multiple types of value in a single let or var.\nlet firstScore = (name: \"Bob\", score: 9)\n\nYou may access elements through calling the index similar to Array\nfirstScore.0 // \"Bob\"\nfirstScore.1 // 9\n\nYou may also access the elements through the labels.\nfirstScore.name // \"Bob\"\nfirstScore.score // 9\n\nHowever, you don't have to specify the argument labels.\nlet secondScore = (\"Rob\", 10)\nsecondScore.0\nsecondScore.1\n\nPractical Usage\nThis is your past.\nlet httpFailure: [Any] = [401, \"Fail\"]\n\nYou no longer have to upcast to Any.\nlet httpSuccess = (code: 200, description: \"success\")\nhttpSuccess.code\n\nBonus Tips\nYou created multiple instances in a single line.\n// Okay\nvar dog = \"dog\", cat = \"cat\"\nprint(dog)\n\nInstead, you may use tuple\n// Better\nvar (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3)\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n\nYou may convert an array into a tuple that contains index and element through the enumerated() method.\nvar shoppingList = [\"Eggs\", \"Milk\", \"Rice\"]\n7\nfor (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {\n  print(index, value)\n}\n\nSource Code\n\n1009-set-tuple.playground\n\nReference\n\nSwift API Design Guidelines by the Swift Official Blog\n\nConclusion\nTo recap, Set is used to group non-duplicate items with no order. Tuple is used to group all kinds of types with the order you define.  Second, you've learned how to identify mutating vs non-mutating methods based on the naming guide. Make sure you follow the same principle in your codebase as well. Don't get too caught up with Functional Programming. I know it sounds cool. You will get a taste of it in chapter 3, Intro to Functional Swift.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to write modular and beautiful code with extension.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/extension.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/extension.html","title":"Extension","keywords":"","body":"Extension\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 10 of The Swift Fundamentals.

If you do not know how to work with computed properties which you will learn in Chapter 2.\n\nCheck\nCreate an object called bob.\nlet bob = Bob()\nbob.description // I'm Bob, I know work\"\n\nYou may use init(enterSkill: String) from the extension block.\nlet newBob = Bob(enterSkill: \"Drawing\")\nnewBob.description // I'm Bob, I know drawing\"\n\nExtend Swift Native Types\n\nRemember, Int just a struct\n\nInstead of creating a separate function, you may extend Int and add a property.\nextension Int {\n  var squared: Int {\n    return self * self\n  }\n}\n\nNow, objects whose type is Int, contain the squared property.\nlet myNumber = 10 // self is 10\nmyNumber.squared // 100\n\nThe Rule\n\nYou may not have a stored property within extension.\n\nThe Scope\nAs mentioned, extension allows developers to implement all kinds of features.\n\nAdd computed instance properties and computed type properties\nDefine instance methods and type methods\nProvide new initializers\nDefine subscripts\nDefine and use new nested types with enum/struct\nMake an existing type conform to a protocol\n\nSource Code\n\n1010-extension.playground\n\nConclusion\nYou've learned the meaning of self.

You will learn how to become lazy.  In other words, you become smarter and effective when it comes to initializing an object. In programming, getting lazy to write less code is in fact good for your teammates and users as long as it's readable and gets the job done. Bill Gates once mentioned, whenever there is hard work to be done, he assigns it to the laziest person as he or she is sure to find an easy way of doing it.\nProblem\nI'm lazy. Can we initialize quickly?\nCreate Class with Designated Init\nCreate a class called Human\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n }\n\n  // Convenience init intializes the designated init method\n  convenience init() {\n    self.init(name: \"Bob Lee\")\n  }\n}\n\nConvenience init initializes the designated init method by calling self.init.\nCreate Object\nlet lee = Human(name: \"Bob Lee\") // init(name: String)\nlet bob = Human() // Convenience init()\n\nInitialize UIColor\nCreate an instance that stores UIColor.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet randomColor = UIColor(colorLiteralRed: 255/255, green: 80/255, blue: 85/255, alpha: 1)\n\nCustom Convenience Init\nCreate our own convenience init that initializes the designated init by adding extension to UIColor.\nextension UIColor {\n convenience init(r: Float, g: Float, b: Float) {\n   self.init(colorLiteralRed: r/255, green: g/255, blue: b/255, alpha: 1)\n }\n}\n\nlet myFavoriteColor = UIColor(r: 255, g: 80, b: 85)\n\nApplication\n\nQuick initialization for open source projects\nCustom convenience inits with UIKit\n\nSource Code\n2001-convenience-init.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to become lazy and effective at the same time.

I will walk you through by placing your feet on mine.\nProblem\nDo we have to make functions all the time to calculate something?\nAtrocious Code\nUnrelated functions that take up many lines. The functions below are used to calculate a radius and diameter.\nfunc getDiameter(radius: Double) -> Double {\n return radius * 2\n}\nfunc getRadius(diameter: Double) -> Double {\n return diameter / 2\n}\n\ngetDiameter(radius: 10) // return 20\ngetRadius(diameter: 200) // return 100\ngetRadius(diameter: 600) // return 300\n\nThe two functions are separate and there is no relationship . Computed Property will help you solve this problem.\nIntroducing Computed Property\nYou may create a variable that only can be read. It is also referred to as a gettable property.\n\nComputed = calculated\n\nGettable Property\nCreate a only readable property.\nclass NumberClass {\n  var readableNumber: Double {\n    get {\n      // Complex logic\n      return 777\n    }\n  }\n  var readableNumbers: Double {\n    return 789\n  }\n}\n\nIf you attempt to modify the property, it will give you an error.\nreadableNumber = 10 // Error\nreadableNumbers = 20 // Error\n\nGettable and Settable Property\nYou may not only make a property gettable, but also settable by inserting set right after get.  Let us create a relationship between radius and diameter.\nvar radius: Double = 10\nvar diameter: Double {\n  get {\n    return radius * 2\n  }\n  set {\n    radius = newValue / 2\n  }  \n}\n\nnewValue refers to the newly set value of diameter.  For example, when you set diameter to 100,  newValue becomes 100.\ndiameter = 50\nradius = 100\ndiameter // 200\n\nInstead of calling newValue, you may add a different name. In the example below, there is a relationship between area and side. Instead of calling newValue, let us use newArea.\nimport Foundation\n\nvar side: Double = 100\nvar area: Double {\n get {\n   return side * side\n }\n set(newArea) {\n   side = sqrt(newArea)\n }\n}\n\nThere is a relationship between side and area.\narea = 1000\nside // 31.6\n\nApplications\n\nGrabbing and storing data the server\nPropagating relationships between properties\nPreventing others from manipulating your code\n\nSource Code\n\n2002-computed-property.playground\n\nConclusion\n You've learned what it means to create a gettable property that can be only read.

As we've discussed many times, anything that has to do with ? in the Swift Programming Language will give you an optional value. Second, you reviewed the Swift error handling approach. Remember, the throw keyword is not only used within an else-if or guard block, but also within an init method.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to override everything while subclassing.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

You will master the word super and override. A lot of beginners  have no clue because they simply copy from StackOver Flow and shallow tutorials. I was one of them. That's no longer acceptable from now on.\nProblem\nProblem: Super... Super.init?\nExample from UIViewController\nYou might have seen something like this below.\nimport UIKit\n\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\n  override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    print(\"Hello\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The viewDidLoad() method runs automatically by the UIViewController class.\n\nMany wonder what super and override stand for. Let us find out.\nCreate Vehicle Class\nCreate a class called Vehicle. It contains one gettable property and one method.\nclass Vehicle {\n  var description: String {\n    return \"Hello, I'm moving at 30km/hr\"\n  }\n\n  func warning() {\n    print(\"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\")\n  }\n}\n\nOverride Method and Property\nCreate a class called, ToyCar, and inherit Vehicle. You may customize inherited properties and methods by inserting override.  You may access inherited properties and methods by calling super.\nclass ToyCar: Vehicle {\n  override var description: String {\n    return \"\\(super.description) hey, I'm a cute car\"\n  }\n\n  override func warning() {\n    print(\"hello, don't mind me\")\n    super.warning()\n  }\n}\n\nNow, let us access the description property and the warning method of ToyCar.\nlet myFutureCar = ToyCar()\nmyFutureCar.description\n// \"Hello, I'm moving at 30km/hr hey I'm a cute car\"\nmyFutureCar.warning()\n// \"hello, don't mind me\"\n// \"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\"\n\nSuper Init\nYou may override an init method from the super class. Remember, every property must be initialized even the ones from the super class.\nDesign Super Class\nCreate a class that contain a property called, origin.\nclass Human {\n var origin: String\n\n init(enterOrgin: String) {\n   origin = enterOrgin\n }\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nCreate a subclass, called Korean that inherits from Human. The Korean class contains a property called, name.  However, when you initialize, you must initialize the origin property from the Human class by calling super.init.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  let city: String\n\n  init(enterCity: String) {\n    self.city = enterCity\n    super.init(enterOrgin: \"Korean\")\n  }\n\n  init(enterCity: String, origin: String) {\n    self.city = enterCity\n    super.init(enterOrgin: origin)\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Object\nThere are two init methods in the Korean class. You may choose any since both initialize the origin property from the Human class.\nlet bob = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\")\nlet bobby = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\", myOrigin: \"Korean\")\n\nOverride Init\nNot only you may override methods and properties, but also init methods.\nDesign Base Class\nDesign a class called, Tesla. It contains a property called, numberOfWheels.\nclass Tesla {\n  var numberOfWheels: Int\n\n  init(enterWheelNumber: Int) {\n    numberOfWheels = enterWheelNumber\n  }\n}\n\nDesign SubClass\nDesign a called, ModelS that inherits Tesla. Add the override keyword in front of the init method and call super.init to initialize the property from the Tesla class. Once you initialize the property, you may add additional lines of code for customization.\nclass ModelS: Tesla {\n  override init(enterWheelNumber: Int) {\n    super.init(enterWheelNumber: enterWheelNumber)\n    print(\"Wow, you've got a nice car\")\n  }\n}\n\nModelS(enterWheelNumber: 50) // Wow, you've got a nice car\n\nSource Code\n\n2005-override-init-method-property.playground\n\nConclusion\nFrom now on, you no longer have to fear super.init, super.viewDidLoad, and override. If you feel stuck, I recommend you to watch the lecture multiple times and then ask questions if necessary. You've got to understand every piece of information from here. If not, you will suffer. A lot.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how one init method can initialize the other.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

You will learn how one init method may initialize the other. The process is analogous to that of convenience. At the end, you will learn how the NASA could have saved millions of dollars if they used the feature Swift offers.\nProblem\nHow can one init init the other?\nDesign Rocket Ship\nDesign a struct called NuclearRocket. There are two init methods and two properties: meters and liters.\nstruct NuclearRocket {\n  var meters: Double\n  var liters: Double\n\n  // Init for &#x1F1F0;&#x1F1F7;\n  init(meters: Double, liters: Double) {\n    self.meters = meters\n    self.liters = liters\n  }\n\n  // Init for &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8;\n  init(ft: Double, gallons: Double) {\n    let convertedMeters = ft / 3.28\n    let convertedLiters = gallons * 3.79\n    self.init(meters: convertedMeters, liters: convertedLiters)\n  }\n}\n\nUsing the second init method, you may initialize the properties using ft and gallon. Yet, you've initalized the meters and liters properties by callingself.init.\nCreate Object\nFor Korean scientists\nvar rocket = NuclearRocket(meters: 20, liters: 20)\nrocket.liters // 20\nrocket.meters // 20\n\nFor American scientists\nvar newRocket = NuclearRocket(ft: 300, gallons: 2)\nnewRocket.liters // 7.56\nnewRocket.meters // 91.4\n\nSource Code\n\n2006-two-phase-init.playground\n\nConclusion\nIn 1998, The NASA launched The Mars Climate robot to study the Mars. However, a year later, it went out of the orbit. It was due to the computer software which produced non-SI units. The program returned units of pound instead of the SI units of newton. $327.6 million evaporated. They could have potentially used  two phase initializations in Swift.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to use methods and properties without creating an actual object.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

You are going to learn one of the most useful, yet confusing topics.\nProblem\n I'm confused by static, final, class. What are those?\nStatic Property and Method\nNo longer have to initialize an object to access properties and methods. Let us design a struct that contains a type property and a type method.\nDesign Struct\nstruct SomeStructure {\n  static var storedTypeProperty = \"Some value.\"\n  static var computedProperty: Int {\n    get {\n      return 120\n    }\n    set {\n      print(\"You've set to \\(newValue)\")\n    }\n  }\n  static func hello() {\n    print(\"hello\")\n  }\n}\n\nAccess the properties and methods\nSomeStructure.storedTypeProperty // \"Some Value\"\nSomeStructure.hello() // 'hello\"'\n\n\nAnything that has static in front will not be overridden.\n\nClass\nUnlike static, class is only used within Classes. On the other hand, classes also support static.\n\nUnlike static, class properties may be overridden.\n\nDesign Class\nCreate a class called GrandParent.\nclass GrandParent {\n  static var numberOfYearsInMarriage = 30\n  static func introduce() {\n    print(\"We've been married for \\(numberOfYearsInMarriage)\")\n }\n\n  class func introducing() {\n    print(\"We've been married for \\(numberOfYearsInMarriage)\")\n  }\n\n  final func cantOverride() {\n    print(\"you can't change me\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nNow, create Parent class that inherits GrandParent.  You may override class func introducing(), but you may not override final func cantOverride(). final prevents Classes from overriding.\nclass Parent: GrandParent {\n  override class func introducing() {\n    print(\"I'm married for 5 years\")\n  }\n//  override static func introduce() {\n//    print(\"I'm married for 5 years\")\n//  }\n}\n\nParent.introducing() // \"I'm married for 5 years\"\n\nPractical Usage\nYou may store a list of items.\nstruct BluetoothID {\n struct iPhone {\n   static let iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n   static let iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n   static let iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n   static let iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n   static let iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n }\n}\n\nBluetoothID.iPhone.iPhone8 // \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\nBluetoothID.iPhone.iPhone8 // \"\"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n\nAlternative\nYou may also use enum.\nenum AirDropID: String {\n case iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n case iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n case iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n case iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n case iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n}\n\nAirDropID.iPhone8.rawValue // \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n\nSource Code\n\n2007-type-property-method.playground\n\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to access properties and methods without creating an object. When you work structs, you may only have static type. When you work classes, however, you may have static and class type. If you wish to prevent any property from being overridden, you may use the final keyword.\nWhen you start taking The UIKit Fundamentals with Bob, you will discover the beauty of static methods and properties.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to create the only object that exists everywhere.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

You will learn how to create an object that exists anywhere. The object is like me. There is only one Bob. I'm omnipresent.\nDefinition of Singleton\nA singleton is an object which is instantiated exactly once.\nDesign Class\nCreate a class called, AccountManager.  It has a static property with an object of the class itself.\nclass AccountManager {\n  static let sharedInstance = AccountManager()\n\n  var userInfo = (ID: \"bobthedev\", Password: 01036343984)\n\n  // Networking: communicating server\n  func network() {\n    // get everything\n  }\n\n  private init() { }\n}\n\n\nThe private  prevents initialization outside of the AccountManager class.

Again, think of me. There is only one Bob the Developer.\nOften developers avoid the singleton pattern at all cost. It exists everywhere, and when you have a number of them, it becomes difficult to track. So, I'd recommend not to overuse the pattern.

For example, a programmer writing code that involves numerical operations may not be interested in the way numbers are represented in the underlying hardware and its assembly language. In iOS Development, developers use frameworks created and encapsulated by Apple UIKit engineers.\nCode Smell \n\nOmen that causes bad future\n\nUniversal Smell\n\nNeedless complexity\nDuplication\nOverused typed literals\nOver usage of var instead of let\n\nObject Oriented Programming\n\n\"One does it all\" Class\nLong method\n\nKISS\n\nKeep it simple stupid\n\nLess code takes less time to write, has less bugs, and is easier to modify. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\nAvoid inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding and other complicated OOP concepts. Use delegation and simple if-constructs instead.\nUse simple brute-force solutions first instead of complicated algorithms. Slower algorithms will work in the first place.\nFor slightly unrelated but rather small pieces of functionality use private methods instead of an additional class.\nYAGNI\nAvoid Creating a YAGNI (You aren’t going to need it) - You should try not to add functionality until you need it.\nLaw of Demeter\nThe Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs.\n\nEach unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units \"closely\" related to the current unit.\nEach unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers. Only talk to your immediate friends.\n\nElaboration\nAny section of code (code block, function, class, etc) should minimize the dependencies on other areas of code. This is achieved by using shared variables as little as possible. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and maintainability.\nEliminate, minimize, and reduce complexity of necessary relationships.\nBy hiding implementation details, coupling is reduced.\nHide Implementation Detail\nHiding implementation details allows change to the implementation of a code component while minimally affecting any other modules that use that component.\nA software module hides information (i.e. implementation details) by providing an interface, and not leak any unnecessary information.\nYou may follow a couple principles:\n\nMinimize accessibility of classes and members.\nDon’t expose member data in public.\nAvoid putting private implementation details into a class’s interface.\nDecrease coupling to hide more implementation details.\n\n\n\nBoy-Scout Rule\n\"Leave the campground cleaner than you found it”. The boy-scout rule states that we should always leave the code cleaner than we found it.\nWhy\nWhen making changes to an existing codebase the code quality tends to degrade, accumulating technical debt. Following the boyscout rule, we should mind the quality with each commit.\nHow\nWith each commit make sure it does not degrade the codebase quality.\nAny time someone sees some code that isn’t as clear as it should be, they should take the opportunity to fix it right there and then.\nWriting code is similar to breeding living organisms. Before one releases, make sure the code provides value to the community.
